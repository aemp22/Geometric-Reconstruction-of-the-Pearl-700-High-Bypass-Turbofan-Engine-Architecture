# Geometric-Reconstruction-of-the-Pearl-700-High-Bypass-Turbofan-Engine-Architecture
This project involved reverse-engineering the Rolls-Royce Pearl 700 turbofan engine using Fusion 360 to create a detailed 3D CAD model. The design includes all major componentsâ€”from the diffuser, fan, 4 stage LPC,  10 stage HPC, combustion chamber, 2 stage HPT, 4 LPT, and nozzle) to support design visualization and deepen understanding of aircraft propulsion systems.
